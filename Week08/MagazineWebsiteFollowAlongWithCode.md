# Magazine Website: Follow-Along Activity
Create a simple website for a magazine! It will be up to you to decide what topic the magazine should cover. Some examples:

- [Dirigibles (aka blimps)](https://replit.com/@HylandOutreach/MagazineDirigibleDigest)
- Music Reviews
- [Interior Design](https://replit.com/@laurenhollosy/week-8-example-interior-design)
- Fashion
- Sports
- Anything!

## Setup
Start from [this Starter Repl](https://replit.com/@HylandOutreach/MagazineStarter), and then follow the instructions below.

## Big Header
Bootstrap has built-in CSS class rulesets for headers called **Jumbotron**s. In order to use them, add some new HTML elements, and then add `class`es to them.

### Basic HTML
1. Within the `<body></body>` element, add a `div` element
1. Within the `<div></div>` element, add an `h1` element that says "TOPIC Magazine"
1. Within the `<div></div>` element, add a `p` element that says "News and information related to TOPIC"

Open the file in a browser to see how it renders. It has the proper font, it needs to be centered and placed within a large header banner!

### Jumbotron
1. Add a `class` attribute to the `div` element containing the header content
1. Set the value of the `class` attribute to "jumbotron"
1. Open the file in a browser to see the banner!
1. Back in the HTML file, add an additional `class` of "text-center" to the `div`
    - Use a space between the two classes to specify that the `div` has both classes
1. Open the file in a browser to see the text centered!

### Adding CSS
To make the subtitle text appear _italic_, follow the steps below:
1. In the HTML file, add an `id` attribute to the `p` element, and set it to "subtitle"
1. In the CSS file, create a new ruleset for the `p` with an `id` of "subtitle"
1. Within the "subtitle" ruleset, create a new declaration setting `font-style` to `italic`
1. Open the file in a browser to see the italicized text!

#### Code
##### HTML
```html
<div class="jumbotron text-center">
    <h1>TOPIC Magazine</h1>
    <p id="subtitle">News and information related to TOPIC</p>
</div>
```

##### CSS
```css
#subtitle {
    font-style: italic;
}
```

## Article 1
Add an article about your topic to the webpage. Ultimately, it should be laid out in a grid format, like a newspaper, and take up half of a row within a container.

### Basic HTML
1. Within the `<body></body>` element, underneath the jumbotron `<div></div>`, create another `div`
    - This `div` will represent the container for the rows
1. Within the container `<div></div>`, create another `div`
    - This `div` will represent one row within the container
1. Within the row `<div></div>`, create another `div`
    - This `div` will represent one article
1. Within the article `<div></div>`, create an `h3` header saying "article 1"
1. Within the article `<div></div>`, under the `h3`, create a `p`
1. Add some text within the `<p>` and `</p>` - it can be quick at first, but you'll want to have more content later!

Open the file in a browser to see how it renders. It has the proper content, but it needs some Bootstrap classes so that it appears within the grid!

### Container / Row / Column
1. Add a `class` attribute to the container `div`, and set its value to "container"
1. Open the file in a browser, and notice the space is automatically added on the sides of the container
1. Add a `class` attribute to the row `div`, and set its value to "row"
1. Add a `class` attribute to the article `div`, and set its value to "col-md-6"
    - This will make the `div` take up 6 12ths (or one half) of the available row space
1. Open the file in a browser to see the article take up the proper amount of space

#### Code
```html
<div class="container">
    <div class="row">
        <div class="col-md-6">
            <h3>article 1</h3>
            <p>text</p>
        </div>
    </div>
</div>
```

## Article 2
Add an additional article to the webpage. The second article should take up the other part of the first row.

### HTML for Article 2
1. Within the row `<div></div>`, underneath the existing article `<div></div>`, add another `div` element
1. Add a class attribute to the new `div` element and set it to "col-md-6"
    - This way, the two article `div` elements will take up all the available space (`6`+`6`=`12`)
1. Within the new article `<div></div>`, create an `h3` header saying "article 2"
1. Within the article `<div></div>`, under the `h3`, create a `p`
1. Add some text to the paragraph!

### Adding CSS for All Articles
To make the article text appear dark grey, follow the steps below:
1. In the HTML file, add a `class` attribute to the `p` elements containing article text, and set the values to "article-text"
1. In the CSS file, create a new ruleset for the `p`s with a `class` of "article-text"
1. Within the "article-text" ruleset, create a new declaration setting `color` to `grey`
1. Open the file in a browser to see the dark grey text!

#### Code
##### HTML
```html
 <div class="col-md-6">
    <h3>article 1 title</h3>
    <p class="article-text">
        article text goes here
    </p>
</div>
<div class="col-md-6">
    <h3>article 2 title</h3>
    <p class="article-text">
        super cool text here
    </p>
</div>
```

##### CSS
```css
.article-text {
    color: grey;
}
```

## Template Code
At this point, the project should look something like [this](https://replit.com/@HylandOutreach/MagazineStarterMidPoint#index.html)... it should have all the basic structure for a magazine!

##### HTML
```html
<html>
    <head>
        <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
        <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.3.1/css/bootstrap.min.css">
        <link rel="stylesheet" href="MagazineWebsite.css" type="text/css">
    </head>
    <body>
        <div class="jumbotron text-center">
            <h1>TOPIC Magazine</h1>
            <p id="subtitle">News and information related to TOPIC</p>
        </div>
        <div class="container">
            <div class="row">
                <div class="col-md-6">
                    <h3>article 1 title</h3>
                    <p class="article-text">
                        article text goes here
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="col-md-6">
                    <h3>article 2 title</h3>
                    <p class="article-text">
                        super cool text here
                    </p>
                </div>
            </div>
        </div>
    </body>
</html>
```

##### CSS
```css
#subtitle {
  font-style: italic;
}

.article-text {
  color: grey;
}
```
