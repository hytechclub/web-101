# HTML Elements
For this lesson's content, cover HTML's most-used elements. The primary focus of this lesson is to make the students more comfortable with HTML, and show them more they can do with it. Teach attribute syntax, and many new elements including inputs.

## Warm-Up
For a warm-up this week, do a quick form icebreaker. [Open the form here.](https://forms.office.com/Pages/DesignPageV2.aspx?subpage=design&FormId=iNuljKul90il4EzlCTX4B33juYEmlJlJpIkctSGCv9RUODk5QUQwSE1VS1NaS0RKOTlON05TSVIzVS4u&Token=bb860232bab6460fab03cc488fd13c20)

When it's open, click "Present" in the upper right to see responses as they arrive. Discuss student answers as desired - and note that this same form will be used for both the virtual and in-person classrooms.

The other important piece of this warm-up is the opportunity for students to consider final project ideas. They will have a chance to start a final project during the self-paced work portion of the lesson. When there is time to work on their projects, they should prioritize the vision, planning, and content over the HTML/CSS code - this will make it a little more flexible as the new lessons inform the possibilities for the sites.

## Lecture
This [presentation](BasicHtmlElements.pptx) focuses mostly on how different elements are used to accomplish the goals of the webpage.

## Group Activity: Name That Element
Facilitate the [Name That Element](NameThatElement.pptx) game. For each element, instructors can ask multiple questions, and call on students randomly.

## Code-Along Activity: Pizza Website
Students will begin to create a website for a pizza restaurant which includes a list of locations and an order form: [PizzaWebsiteCodeAlong](PizzaWebsiteCodeAlong.md)

## Self-Paced Work: Pizza Website Updates
Students will update their pizza website: [PizzaWebsiteSelfPacedWork](PizzaWebsiteSelfPacedWork.md)

They are also, always, encouraged to continue work on their final projects! They should consider ways to update their site with the new elements covered in this week's lesson.

## Challenges
There are a wide variety of challenges for the students to tackle.
