# Basic HTML Elements
For the first content lesson of the class, go over HTML elements. The purpose of this lesson is to show the students what they can create with some basic elements. Overall, this first lesson should be pretty straightforward. Introduce HTML, show the students some examples and have them get some hands-on experience writing HTML.

## Warm-Up
It may be helpful to begin this session with an Icebreaker. After that, the instructor can pose a question to the students and let them write down their answers. The question could be something like "What do you think HTML does?", "How do you think websites work?", etc. Students can volunteer answers after 5 minutes or so.

## Lecture
This [presentation](BasicHtmlElements.pptx) focuses mostly on how different elements are used to accomplish the goals of the webpage.

## Group Activity: Name That Element
Facilitate the [Name That Element](NameThatElement.pptx) game. For each element, instructors can ask multiple questions, and call on students randomly.

## Code-Along: About Me Website
Follow the [instructions](AboutMeCodeAlong.md) to start building an "About Me" website.

## Self-Paced Work: About Me Website Updates
Students should follow [the instructions](SelfPacedWork.md) to continue building their "About Me" website.

## Challenges
There are two challenge pages for this week:

- The students will be challenged to [create multiple HTML files and link between them](MultipleHtmlFilesChallenge.md)
- There is also a challenge for the students to build a [Choose Your Own Adventure](ChooseYourOwnAdventureChallenge.md) game
