# HTML Elements
For this lesson's content, cover HTML's most-used elements. The primary focus of this lesson is to make the students more comfortable with HTML, and show them more they can do with it. Teach attribute syntax, and many new elements including inputs.

## Warm-Up
For a warm-up this week, do a quick form icebreaker. [View responses here](https://hylandsw-my.sharepoint.com/:x:/g/personal/techoutreachteam_hyland_com/IQAB643k7BMaRY1CwOioLwxVAUh4_hgiMQj6N--spzYus5Q?e=yifvTy)

The other important piece of this warm-up is the opportunity for students to consider final project ideas. They will have a chance to start a final project during the self-paced work portion of the lesson. When there is time to work on their projects, they should prioritize the vision, planning, and content over the HTML/CSS code - this will make it a little more flexible as the new lessons inform the possibilities for the sites.

## Lecture
This [presentation](BasicHtmlElements.pptx) focuses mostly on how different elements are used to accomplish the goals of the webpage.

## Group Activity: Name That Element
Facilitate the [Name That Element](NameThatElement.pptx) game. For each element, instructors can ask multiple questions, and call on students randomly.

## Code-Along Activity: About Me Website
Students will create a website about themselves: [AboutMeCodeAlong](AboutMeCodeAlong.md)

## Self-Paced Work: Challenges / Final Project Ideas
After the code-along activity, students should have some time to work on their own. They can do any number of things:

- Keep working on their "About Me" websites (possibly [adding multiple pages](MultipleHtmlFilesChallenge.md))
- Create a [text-based "Choose Your Own Adventure" game](ChooseYourOwnAdventureChallenge.md)
- Think of how they can use the HTML elements from this lesson to update their final projects
