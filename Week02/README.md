# Basic HTML Elements
For the first content lesson of the class, go over HTML elements. The purpose of this lesson is to show the students what they can create with some basic elements. Overall, this first lesson should be pretty straightforward. Introduce HTML, show the students some examples and have them get some hands-on experience writing HTML.

## Warm-Up
For a warm-up this week, do a quick form icebreaker. [Open the form here.](https://forms.office.com/Pages/DesignPageV2.aspx?subpage=design&FormId=iNuljKul90il4EzlCTX4B33juYEmlJlJpIkctSGCv9RUODk5QUQwSE1VS1NaS0RKOTlON05TSVIzVS4u&Token=bb860232bab6460fab03cc488fd13c20)

When it's open, click "Present" in the upper right to see responses as they arrive. Discuss student answers as desired - and note that this same form will be used for both the virtual and in-person classrooms.

The other important piece of this warm-up is the opportunity for students to consider final project ideas. They will have a chance to start a final project during the self-paced work portion of the lesson.

## Lecture
This [presentation](BasicHtmlElements.pptx) focuses mostly on how different elements are used to accomplish the goals of the webpage.

## Group Activity: Name That Element
Facilitate the [Name That Element](NameThatElement.pptx) game. For each element, instructors can ask multiple questions, and call on students randomly.

## Code-Along: About Me Website
Follow the [instructions](AboutMeCodeAlong.md) to start building an "About Me" website.

## Self-Paced Work: Final Project!
Students should follow [the instructions](SelfPacedWork.md) to start working on their final projects.

## Challenges
There are two challenge pages for this week:

- The students will be challenged to [create multiple HTML files and link between them](MultipleHtmlFilesChallenge.md)
- There is also a challenge for the students to build a [Choose Your Own Adventure](ChooseYourOwnAdventureChallenge.md) game
