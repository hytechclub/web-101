# Challenge: Creating multiple HTML files
Often, websites will consist of multiple webpages, each with their own information. Add some links to your "About Me" webpage that lead to pages containing more information about yourself!

## Instructions
For each of the items listed below, create a **new** HTML page. Make sure to name it with a `.html` at the end. On the pages, include a header, some paragraphs, some images, and possibly links.

- Family
    - Fill the HTML page with information about your family tree and family history (include pets)
- Interest
    - Write in-depth about an interest of yours (e.g., sports, music, art, fashion, writing, etc)
- Career Aspiration
    - Provide some information about what career you would like once you become an adult

Once you have created your new HTML pages, link them from your main "About Me" page! Create a new section, with a header that says **More Information**. Then, include a paragraph about each of your additional pages, and use an `a` anchor tag to link to them.

### Further explorations
If you complete the above instructions, research the following tags and add them throughout your "About Me" page:
- `<br>`
- `<audio>`
- `<code>`
- `<del>`
- `<details>`
