# About Me: Individual
Continue the development of your "About Me" webpage.

## Favorite food
Create a new section on your webpage that will describe your favorite foods. You will need to provide information about at least two foods you enjoy. Under the "Favorite Animal" section, add another `h3` header that says "Favorite Foods". Then, repeat the instructions below for two (or more) of your favorite foods.

1. Add a smaller `h4` header with the name of your favorite food
    - Within the header, indicate the rank of this food (e.g., "1. Rice")
1. Add an image of your favorite food in an `img` image tag
1. Add a brief description of your favorite food within a `p` paragraph
1. Add a link (`a` anchor tag) to the website of a restaurant where you can purchase your favorite food

## Additional Challenge
For an additional challenge, instead of adding a link at the bottom of your food section, make the image itself a link!
