# Code-Along: About Me Website
With this exercise, you will create a webpage that shows some information about yourself. Start by forking [this empty Repl](https://replit.com/@HylandOutreach/EmptyWeb), and then follow the instructions below.

## Setup
Start by setting up the basics of the website.

1. In the **index.html** file, add the `<html></html>` opening and closing tag
1. Inside of the `<html>` and `</html>`, add the `<body></body>` opening and closing tag
1. Inside of the `<body>` and `</body>`, add a `<h1></h1>` header tag that says "About Me"
1. Click the **Run** button to make sure your page is working!

At the end of the **Setup**, your code should look like this (try to match the spacing):

```html
<html>
    <body>
        <h1>About Me</h1>
    </body>
</html>
```

## Greeting and Basic Information
Next, add some basic information about yourself.

1. Under the `h1` header tag, add in a `<p></p>` paragraph tag welcoming the user to your page
1. Add another paragraph containing your name
1. Add another paragraph containing your grade level
1. Add another paragraph containing your hometown

At the end of this section, your code should look something like this:

```html
<html>
    <body>
        <h1>About Me</h1>

        <p>Welcome to my page!</p>
        <p>My name is Arthur Read</p>
        <p>I am in 3rd grade</p>
        <p>I am from Elwood City</p>
    </body>
</html>
```

## Favorite Animal
Now it's time to add a picture of your favorite animal!

1. Under the last `p` paragraph tag, add a smaller `h3` header that says "Favorite Animal"
1. Add an image of your favorite animal
    1. Find an image somewhere online, and copy the **image URL**
    1. Add an `<img>` image tag under the `h3` header
    1. Set the `src` of the image to the URL, in quotes
1. Add a paragraph with some text about your favorite animal
1. Add a link to the Wikipedia page for your animal
    1. Find the Wikipedia page URL online
    1. Add an `<a></a>` anchor tag under the `p` paragraph
    1. Set the `href` of the image to the URL, in quotes
    1. Inside of the anchor tag, insert the text "Wikipedia"

**Note: For external `a` elements to work in Repl, the project must be opened in a separate window:**

## Final HTML
By the end of the activity, the HTML code should look something like this:

```html

    <body>
        <h1>About Me</h1>

        <p>Welcome to my page!</p>
        <p>My name is Arthur Read</p>
        <p>I am in 3rd grade</p>
        <p>I am from Elwood City</p>
