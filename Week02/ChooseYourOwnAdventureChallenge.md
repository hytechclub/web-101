# Choose Your Own Adventure: Challenge
Create a new website for a [Choose Your Own Adventure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choose_Your_Own_Adventure)-style game.

## First Page
First, create an HTML page that will serve as the starting point for the adventure. It should have at least one image, a header, and a paragraph introducing the game.

The story should begin on the first page. This can be any type of story at all. The the only constraint is that at the bottom of the first page, there should be two links that allow the user to choose between two ways to continue the story.

## Choosing Pages
The two links on the first page should link to additional HTML pages with different paths for the story. That way, the user can **choose** which HTML page to visit next! Create the two HTML pages that correspond to the two links on the first page.

## More Pages
Try to fill out the story as much as possible. Add a number of different choices for each page, and allow the story to continue down a number of branches. It may be helpful to write out the story and each branch before putting it into code. For an added challenge, try to include the links as part of the text, like:
