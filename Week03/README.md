# More HTML Elements
This week is all about introducing more new HTML elements. Students should add these elements to their toolbox, and have more of a chance to practice writing out HTML syntax.

## Agenda

| Activity | Time |
|-|-|
| Warm-Up | 10m |
| Lecture | 20m |
| Code-Along | 40m |
| Break | 10m |
| Self-Paced Work | 40m |

## Warm Up: Blooket
Start class with a [review Blooket](https://dashboard.blooket.com/set/63ff7a6accb65f64e013c334), covering the content from the previous lesson.

## Lecture
Present the [More HTML Elements](MoreHtmlElements.pptx) lecture.

- Cover new HTML Elements:
    - Lists (unordered/ordered)
    - Inputs
    - Tables
    - Iframes

Examples are available via JSFiddle links.

## Code-Along Activity: Pizza Website
Students will begin to create a website for a pizza restaurant which includes information and an order form: [PizzaWebsiteCodeAlong](PizzaWebsiteCodeAlong.md)

## Self-Paced Work: Challenges / Final Project
After the code-along activity, students should have some time to work on their own. They can do any number of things:

- Keep working on their Pizza Websites (possibly following [these instructions](PizzaWebsiteSelfPacedWork.md))
- Work on a challenge (like an [Oscars site](OscarsChallenge.md) or [Recursive site](RecursionChallenge.md))
- Think of how they can use the HTML elements from this lesson to update their final projects
