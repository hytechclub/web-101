# Overview: Review
Spend the session reviewing all of the content from the course.

## Team Whiteboard Game
Use the [ReviewGame](ReviewGame.pptx) presentation to play a whiteboard game. Split the room into two teams, and each team will send up one representative per question. If they answer the question correctly, their team will receive a point. The team is not allowed to assist the representative, except for in the case of a TEAM CHALLENGE. In a TEAM CHALLENGE, all members of the team can answer the question. If teams are tied after 20 questions, the TIE-BREAKER should be utilized. Teams can buzz in using https://buzzin.live/, which should be set up for them on computers before the question is revealed.

## Follow-Along: Presidents
Walk through the instructions in the [PresidentsFollowAlong](PresidentsFollowAlong.md) file as a group to review many of the concepts covered in the course.

## Animations
There is a follow-along activity in the [AnimationFollowAlong](AnimationFollowAlong.md) file for the students to complete if they would like to learn about CSS animations. There is also a challenge in the [SpinningSquareChallenge](SpinningSquareChallenge.md) file. The students can choose to work on these, or start on their final projects.

## Final Project introduction
Introduce the final project and allow the students to begin brainstorming. This should be concurrent with the animations activities.
