## Overview: HTML Tables and IFrames
For this lesson's content, cover two additional HTML elements: `table`s and `iframe`s. Tables have many tags, and they are somewhat difficult to grasp. This lesson should reinforce nesting, and allow the students to do more with different elements.

## Warm Up
> What types of data are stored in tables (rows/columns)?

## Lecture
Present the [Tables & IFrames](TablesAndIFrames.pptx) lecture.

- Cover new HTML Elements:
    - Tables
        - `table`
        - `tr`
        - `th`
        - `td`
    - Iframes
        - `iframe`

Examples are available via links in the PowerPoint.

## Formative Assessment: Blooket
Present the [Blooket](https://dashboard.blooket.com/set/66c4d317346cedfba9c14074) activity.

## Code-Along Activity: Game Comparison
Students will begin to create a website to compare different games. Data for the games will appear in a table, and reviews for the games will appear in iframes. Walk through [these instructions](GameComparisonCodeAlong.md) to complete the activity.

## Individual Exercise: Game Comparison Updates
Students will update their game comparison website by following [these instructions](GameComparisonIndividual.md). They should also be encouraged to try adding tables or iframes to their final projects!

## Challenge: Oscars Tables
Students will create a webpage providing information about the 95th Academy Awards in the form of tables. Instructions are in the [OscarsChallenge](OscarsChallenge.md) file.

## Challenge: Recursion
Students will put tables inside of tables by following the steps in the [RecursionChallenge](RecursionChallenge.md) file.
