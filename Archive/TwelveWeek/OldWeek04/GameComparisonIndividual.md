# Game Comparison: Individual Exercises
The game comparison website is pretty good, but it could use a little more data. Follow the instructions below to fill out the page with some more information!

### Optional: Final Project Updates
Alternatively, feel free to continue working on your final project! See if you can add a table, or an iframe, or an embedded YouTube video.

## Part 1 - Adding a New Column
Users of the website would like to see information about the type of the game. Add the column to the table, and fill out the data for each of the games listed.

1. In the table header `tr`, add another `th` for "Game Type" after "Price"
1. In each of the table body `tr`s, add the `td` for the game's type
    - Fortnite: Battle Royale
    - Candy Crush Saga: Match-three
    - Pokemon Sword & Shield: Role-playing

## Part 2 - Adding a New Game
Users would like to see more than just three games compared on the website. Add an additional row to the table, containing information for the new game: Monopoly.

1. Under the last `tr` in the `table`, add another `tr`
1. Fill in each `td` with the information for Monopoly
    - Game Title: Monopoly
    - Release Year: 1935
    - Platform: Tabletop
    - Price: $20.99
    - Game Type: Economics-themed

Additionally, users would like to see a review of Monopoly.

1. Under the last `iframe` in the `body`, add an `h3` with the game's name
1. Under the `h3`, add an `iframe` with this review: https://www.reviewgeek.com/110716/a-modern-board-game-history-from-monopoly-to-today/
1. Set the width and height of the `iframe` appropriately
