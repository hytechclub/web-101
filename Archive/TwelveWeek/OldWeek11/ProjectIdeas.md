# Project Ideas
Here are some ideas for projects you could build. Feel free to create a different type of webpage that meets all of the technical requirements for the project too!

## Examples
[Here are some examples from previous semesters.](https://hylandtechclub.com/showcase/Web101/index.html)

## Resumé/Portfolio
One of the most important things you'll need if you want to apply for almost any job is a resumé. It can help you stand out as a great candidate by showing off your skills, education, and previous work experience. For some jobs, you will also need to compile a selection of samples of work into a portfolio. This allows an employer to view everything you've done in one place, and helps them decide to hire you.

Create a webpage that shows off some of the cool things you have done. You should use some of the work you've completed in HTML and CSS, along with anything else you think might be helpful when applying for a job in a field of your choice.

### Functional Requirements
Your final webpage should contain the three sections listed below. A user should be able to navigate between sections easily.

#### Home page
Your home page should be the first page that loads up when a user visits your site. It should provide some basic information, and make it easy to access the Resumé and Portfolio. Try to make it look as interesting as possible to grab the user's attention!

#### Resumé
Create a resumé containing:
- Your name
- Any previous jobs you have had, and how long you had them
- Relevant classes you have taken in school
- Extra-curricular activities in which you participate
- Any additional skills or accolades

#### Portfolio
Your portfolio should show off your best work in any field. For example, if you were a musician, you could include samples of music you have made. If you were an artist, you could include samples of art. If you were an actor, you could include a demo reel (video) of your acting. Whatever you think is worth showing! You should:
- Show at least five samples of your work (from any area)
- Show at least two examples from HTML/CSS
- Come up with some additional HTML/CSS to show off your skills

### Sample portfolios
Use the sample portfolios below for inspiration! Your webpage does not have to be as complex as these, but hopefully they will provide some ideas for things you can do.

## Client Website
You're just starting work at Hyland Web Design, Inc, and you are approached by a new client who needs a website for their band/sports team/etc. They are not sure exactly what they want, but they would like you to provide a structural demonstration with at least two stylistic options. Your job is to come up with a webpage for the client!

### Styles
Create two CSS files that style the page in two different ways. This way, the client has a couple options for aesthetics. Only one CSS file should be applied at a time, but the styles should change when the developer swaps out the CSS.

### Ideas
- Band/Musical Artist
- Sports Team
- Small Business
- Anything else!

### Music Artist Website Example

Create a website for a music artist/band of your choosing. The site could contain the following content:

1. About the band
1. Photos
1. List of band members
1. Tour dates with link(s) to buy tickets
1. Table of information on the latest album
    - Track number
    - Song name
    - Song length
1. Social media link(s)
1. Email subscription form

### Sports Team Website Example

Create a website for a sports team of your choosing. The site could contain the following content:

1. About the team
1. Photos
1. List of upcoming games with link(s) to buy tickets
1. Roster and stats
    - Player name
    - Player number
