## Overview: CSS Selectors and More HTML
This lesson will dive deeper into CSS. This will be mostly pure CSS, plus introducing the class/id attributes and the div/span elements.

## Lecture 1: More Selectors
Present the [first presentation](MoreSelectors.pptx). It covers:

- ID Selectors
- Class Selectors
- Descendant Selectors

## Self-Paced Activity: CSS Diner
Have students play the [CSS Diner](https://flukeout.github.io/) game. Students should complete levels 1-6. If they complete those, they can continue on with the additional levels. **Make sure to consider the timing of this activity. If it lasts longer than 10 minutes, there may not be time for students to work on the self-paced portion of the lesson.**

## Lecture 2: More HTML
Present the [second presentation](MoreHtml.pptx). It covers:

- `<span>` elements
- `<div>` elements

## Code-Along: Pixels
Walk through the [Pixels Code-Along activity](PixelsCodeAlong.md) as a group. Follow the instructions to build a little grid and create a pixel art PAC-MAN.

## Self-Paced Work: Pixel Updates
Students should follow [the instructions](SelfPacedWork.md) to make updates to the pixel art grid.

## Challenges
With remaining time, students can work on the [additional challenges](Challenges.md), or, as always, work on their final projects.
