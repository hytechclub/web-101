# Web 101: CSS Warm-Up
Open up [this warm-up Glitch](https://glitch.com/edit/#!/remix/csswarmup) and try to complete the warm-up activities below. Notice that there is an additional HTML element: `<style></style>`. This is adding some _style_ to the HTML page! > [StackBlitz project](https://stackblitz.com/edit/web-platform-9vbalhmk?file=index.html) <

```html
<html>
	<head>
		<style>
			p {
				color: red;
			}
		</style>
	</head>
	<body>
		<h1>Welcome to My Webpage</h1>
		<p>I think this webpage is really great, and really cool</p>
	</body>
</html>
```

1. Add another paragraph that says "Thank you for visiting my webpage"
2. Change both paragraphs to blue instead of red (HINT: update what is in the `<style></style>` element)
3. CHALLENGE: Change the header to orange!
