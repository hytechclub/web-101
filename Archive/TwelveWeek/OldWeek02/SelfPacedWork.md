# Self-Paced Work: Final Project
Even though the semester has only just begun, it's time to start building your final project!

## Planning
At this point, the most important thing is to come up with a good idea for your project. Don't worry - you can always change it! We just want to make sure you get a head start building something that means something to you.

Take some time to consider a topic for your website. Think about what content you might want to have - different pages, or pictures, or sections, or text.

Check out the [showcase page](https://hylandtechclub.com/showcase/Web101/) to see some examples of previous projects - this might help give you some ideas.

## Starting
You can start by simply filling out text for the opening page of your site! Feel free to copy the [About Me](AboutMeCodeAlong.md) project to begin. Try to add some `<h2>` headers and `<p>` paragraphs with some basic site information.

## Additional Challenges
If you would like to do more with your final project site, or if you would like to explore more possibilities for websites, there are a couple of challenges:

- [Multiple HTML Pages](MultipleHtmlFilesChallenge.md)
- [Choose Your Own Adventure](ChooseYourOwnAdventureChallenge.md)

Feel free to complete them in their own projects, or add the functionality to your final project site!
