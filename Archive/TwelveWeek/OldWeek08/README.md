## Overview: Responsive Design & Bootstrap
Introduce the idea of responsive design, and impress upon the students its importance. Start by doing responsive design manually using pure CSS, and then introduce the Bootstrap framework as a standard alternative.

## Warm Up
Pose this question to the students:

>What are some differences between websites and mobile applications?

Discuss their answers - this will lead into the lesson.

## Lecture
Present the [Responsive Design](ResponsiveDesign.pptx) lecture.

- Responsive Web Design introduction
- Manual responsive web design
    - CodePen individual practice
- Bootstrap framework introduction

## Formative Assessment: Blooket Quiz
Facilitate the [Blooket](https://dashboard.blooket.com/set/63ff832f4b3793b307fb51d3).

## Code-Along Activity: Magazine Website
As a group, walk through the instructions in [MagazineWebsiteFollowAlongWithCode](MagazineWebsiteFollowAlongWithCode.md) to cover the Bootstrap basics. Provide the students with a copy of the follow-along instructions that do not contain code so that they can copy and paste as needed.

## Self-Paced Work
With any remaining time, students can continue working on their magazines, or work on their final projects.

## Challenge: More Bootstrap
Students will learn more about Bootstrap by following the instructions in the [MoreBootstrapChallenge](MoreBootstrapChallenge.md) file.
