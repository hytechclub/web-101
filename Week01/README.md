# Introduction to Hy-Tech Club and Web Development
In this first session of club, students will get to know each other and learn what the rest of the semester will entail. The primary goal is to start building a positive classroom culture, and inspire students to dive headfirst into the rest of the semester.

### Agenda
Here are some general guidelines for the overall flow of the lesson:

| Activity | Time |
|-|-|
| Overview | 10m |
| Icebreaker | 30m |
| Presentation | 15m |
| HyTop Setup | 10m |
| Break | 10m |
| Code-Along | 30m |
| Blooket | 15m |

## Learning Objectives
Students will be able to...

- Get to know each other
- Get to know their instructors
- State the primary objectives for the semester
- Build a simple website
- Consider project ideas

## Lesson Outline
The entirety of the lesson flows through the [PowerPoint Presentation](Welcome.pptx).

### Overview
The first few slides cover an overview of the course, and a little bit of Hy-Tech Club more generally. Hopefully this will help set the right expectations for the students, inspire them to learn about web development, and give them a good idea of our goals for them.

### Icebreaker: Drawasaurus
Play a game of [Drawasaurus](https://drawasaurus.org/) with the group.

#### Note
Because this is the first session of club, introductory segments like the icebreaker are the top priority. If the icebreaker is going a little long, that's okay; it is better to focus on classroom culture building at this point.

### Presentation
After students have warmed up with the icebreaker, it's time for the presentation portion of the [PowerPoint](Welcome.pptx). These slides contain a brief introduction to HTML and CSS, and there are talking points in the slide notes.

### HyTop
Make sure each student [creates a HyTop account](https://hytop.onrender.com/register).

### Code-Along
The next few slides introduce the [code-along activity](CodeAlong.md). Have students open the starter project opened from the [lesson homepage](StudentDesc.md). Make sure they can see the site and edit the code. From there, follow the [code-along instructions](CodeAlong.md) to show the students how to build their own websites!

After the code-along, if there is time, students are welcome to customize their sites.

### Blooket: Formative Assessment
About 10-15 minutes before the end of club, facilitate the Blooket quiz. Log into [Blooket](https://blooket.com), open the [question set](https://dashboard.blooket.com/set/66c4b54dc1559d398a956137), and host the game! Set the time so that it concludes with 1-2 minutes remaining in the session.
