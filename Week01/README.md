## Overview: HTML Introduction
For the first week of the club, focus mainly on developing classroom culture/icebreakers/preliminary stuff. There should be plenty of time for icebreakers, as well as any necessary troubleshooting.

## Icebreakers
Complete one or two of these icebreakers

### Virtual Icebreaker
Complete a virtual activity to allow the students to get to know each other, and encourage them to share their screen/mic/video. One possibility is to have each student go to [Sketchpad](https://sketch.io/sketchpad/) and have them draw something. Then, go around the room and have each student introduce their drawing by sharing their screen.

### Candy Introductions
Each student takes two pieces of candy (there should be a variety), but they are NOT allowed to eat it yet. Once every student has their candy, reveal that each type of candy corresponds to a question they will have to answer! These questions can be:

- Favorite Movie
- Favorite Musical Artist
- Favorite School Subject
- Favorite Vacation Destination
- Favorite TV Show

Or anything like that. Go around the room and have each student answer their questions.

In a virtual environment, the same idea could be accomplished with a question randomizer (like a [spinning wheel](https://pickerwheel.com/)).

### Two Truths and a Lie
Go around the room and have each student say three statements about themselves. One of the statements must not be true. Have the other students attempt to guess which is the lie. If the current student fools all the other students, they can receive candy.

### Snowball Fight
_This icebreaker activity works best with a large space in which to run around_

Each student starts with a piece of paper. They write down a question on the paper, then crumple it up into a ball. After that, students all throw the "snowballs" at each other until an instructor calls time. Then, each student has to answer the question on the snowball closest to them!

In a virtual environment, the same idea could be accomplished by having students submit questions through a form, and then having other students choose from them randomly.

## Kahoot
Most of the students will probably have seen Kahoot already. However, it's still worth introducing them to it within this classroom context.

There is a practice Kahoot that's just trivia (some relevant, some irrelevant): https://play.kahoot.it/#/?quizId=77c21df4-9918-45a7-9542-c7b7f168c1de

## HelloHtml: Introduction to the Web
Present the [HelloHTML PowerPoint](HelloHtml.pptx).

## Replit Introduction
Walk through the [Replit Introduction](ReplitIntroduction.md) with the students. This should set them up for the Hello HTML Challenge.

## HTML Intro Challenge
After the Replit introduction, have the students complete the [HTML Intro Challenge](HtmlIntroChallenge.md) to make sure they grasp the basic HTML concepts. Give the students some time to work independently, and then go over the basic part of the solution. Allow them to continue working before going over the full solution. Ultimately, the students should have a good chance to figure it out on their own, but they should also have support if needed.

## Games
If all students complete the Hello HTML Challenge satisfactorily, the remaining time can be used for games, like [Sporcle](https://www.sporcle.com/), [Drawphone](https://drawphone.tannerkrewson.com/), [Drawasaurus](https://www.drawasaurus.org/), or anything else.
