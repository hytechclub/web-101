# Replit Setup
Get started with Replit.

## Making a Repl Account
Before beginning, make sure you have a Repl account. You can follow [these instructions](https://hylandtechclub.com/ReplitSetup) to set one up if you do not have one.

## Getting Started
Start by creating a **Fork** of a project to get started. A **Fork** is a copy of the project that you own - you'll be able to update and change it however you want!

1. Go to [this empty Project](https://replit.com/@HylandOutreach/BuildingWebsitesStart#index.html)
1. Click the "Fork" button in the upper right 
1. In the popup that appears, enter a new Name for the Repl, and click "Fork Repl"

That's it! The Replit editor should open, and you should be able to start adding code.

>_Note: It is recommended to start from the ["EmptyWeb" project](https://replit.com/@HylandOutreach/EmptyWeb#index.html) instead of creating a new Repl from the HTML template. The template has a lot of extra code that can be a little overwhelming._
