# Replit Introduction
Get started with Replit.

## Making a Repl Account
Before beginning, make sure you have a Repl account. You can follow [these instructions](https://hylandtechclub.com/ReplitSetup) to set one up if you do not have one.

## Getting Started
Start by creating a **Remix** of an empty project to get started, and sharing a **Multiplayer Link** to the project.

1. Go to [this empty Project](https://replit.com/@HylandOutreach/EmptyWeb#index.html)
1. Click the "Fork Repl" button in the upper right (note: it may say "Remix Repl" or something else)

1. In the popup that appears, enter a new Name for the Repl, and click "Fork Repl" (note: it may say "Remix Repl")

1. When the link appears, click the copy button to copy the URL for the **Multiplayer Link**

Once the **Multiplayer Link** has been copied, you can share it with your instructors. This will give them access to your code so they can help you.

## Adding Code
After creating a new Repl project, the next step is to add some code to it! Take a look at the [HTML Intro Challenge](HtmlIntroChallenge.md) for some guidance.
