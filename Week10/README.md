# Week 10: Zine Machine
This week, have students create their own zine using [Zine Machine on Glitch](https://zine-machine.glitch.me/). Students should be able to submit their projects, and hopefully we will even be able to print them out!

There are some [additional](SpinningSquareChallenge.md) [challenges](AnimationFollowAlong.md) as well.

This will also be a good time to introduce the final project in detail, and allow the students to work on it.
