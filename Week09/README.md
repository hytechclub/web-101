# Week 9 Overview: Transitions & Transforms
Introduce some more fun advanced CSS in transitions and transforms. These topics go beyond the core uses of CSS into more exciting and creative territory. CSS can be a powerful tool for creating immersive, aesthetically-pleasing, artistic experiences.

## Review: Quiz
Whether the session is virtual or not, begin class with [a review quiz](https://quizizz.com/admin/quiz/5bd6ec63784210001af3a392/html-css-review).

Note that presenting the quiz will require a Quizizz account. If there are issues, there is a [Blooket quiz](https://dashboard.blooket.com/set/6307a6f9c782a4df94228024) as well (account also required).

## Code-Along Activity: Endangered Species
Start by showing [an example](https://chlorinated-yielding-lark.glitch.me/) of what is possible using CSS transitions and transforms.

Then, as a group, walk through the [Endangered Species Code-Along](EndangeredSpeciesCodeAlong.md) file to introduce these concepts.

## Self-Paced Work: Challenges
There are additional challenges in the [AdditionalChallenges](AdditionalChallenges.md) file.
