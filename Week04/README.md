## Overview: Challenge
The purpose of this session is to review and practice the concepts taught so far.

## Warm Up: Blooket
Start things off with a [Blooket](https://dashboard.blooket.com/set/63ff7ce04191ce2e2c730a70). Log in, select any game mode, and play the game!

## Challenge
Print out copies of the [completed website](StrangerThingsSite.html), and have the students attempt to recreate the page using HTML. There are [instructions](ReverseEngineeringChallenge.md) for the students to follow. Have a break at some point during the challenge work time.

## Unstructured Check-Ins
While students are working on the challenge, meet with each of them individually to see how things are going for them so far.
