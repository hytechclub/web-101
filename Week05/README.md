## Overview: Challenge
The purpose of this session is to review and practice the concepts taught so far.

## Warm Up: Kahoot
Start things off with a [Kahoot](https://create.kahoot.it/details/54fb9bb7-0030-48b6-90b7-f650538cb604). Save the results.

## Challenge
Print out copies of the [completed website](StrangerThingsSite.html), and have the students attempt to recreate the page using HTML. There are [instructions](ReverseEngineeringChallenge.md) for the students to follow. Have a break at some point during the challenge work time.

## Check-Ins
While students are working on the challenge, meet with each of them individually to see how things are going for them so far.
