## Overview: Introduction to CSS
This lesson will introduce CSS. There will be a little bit of HTML (the `link` tag), but overall this lesson will focus on what CSS is, how it works, the syntax of CSS, some basic element-level selectors, and a handful of CSS properties to get started.

## Warm Up
Give the students 5 minutes to try and complete the warmup activity ([WarmUp.docx](./WarmUp.docx)). They will visit a CodePen and make some changes to it. They have yet to learn CSS, but may be able to pick it up based on the context clues.

At the end of the warmup, briefly show the students Chrome Dev Tools. Update some fonts/colors/font sizes on a webpage (Wikipedia is a good one).

## Lecture
- Explain what CSS does
- Explain where CSS goes
    - External Stylesheets
- Explain how it applies to HTML
- Introduce some basic CSS selectors (element selectors) and properties

## Group Activities
### Review - HTML & CSS
For this activity, the students will be split up into 3-4 teams. Each team will be given a whiteboard to fill out their answers.

The instructors will pull up the [Review](Review.pptx) PowerPoint to display the review questions to the students (Note: the answers are displayed after each question). The students will have time to fill out an answer. After a certain amount of time, the instructors will count down and ask each of the teams to hold up their answers. Each team will get a point for every answer they get correctly. If anyone is talking outside of the time they have to discuss an answer, that team will be deducted a point.

If there is a tie at the end of the round, the tie-breaker question will be used.

The team with the highest amount of points gets candy at the end.

### Follow-Along Activity: Go Bananas
Add basic styles to Banana product page. Have the students start with the HTML code, then follow the instructions in [BananasFollowAlong](BananasFollowAlong.md).

## Individual Exercises: Banana Updates
Update styles for Banana product page. The students should follow the instructions in [BananasIndividual](BananasIndividual.md).

## Challenge: Style a webpage from an image
Given an image of a completed website and some sample HTML, students will write CSS to turn their un-styled HTML into the completed website. Provide the image to the students, along with some instructions. They should put the styles in an external stylesheet. There are some properties that have not been covered in this lesson.

If the students finish the challenge, instructors can send them to https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/ to explore some more CSS properties.
