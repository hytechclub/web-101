## Current Webpage
So far, there is a [simple webpage](https://replit.com/@HylandOutreach/BananaStarter#index.html) that has a lot of information about a banana:

```

All of the information is there, but the page doesn't really pop. It could use a little CSS!

## Adding the First Style
Bananas are yellow (usually), so it would make sense to make the background of the page a nice yellow-ish color. This is possible with an external CSS stylesheet.

### CSS styles
1. Create a new CSS file (call it `Banana.css` and save it in the same folder as the HTML file)
1. In the CSS file, to select the entire page, use the body selector (`body`)
1. Use curly brackets (`{}`) to open the new block, also called a **ruleset**
1. Within the curly brackets, create a new **declaration** that sets the background color to yellow-ish
    - Start on a new line with the background property (`background`)
    - Insert a colon (`:`)
    - Provide the name of the yellow-ish color (`lightgoldenrodyellow`)
    - End it with a semi-colon (`;`)

##### Banana.css
```css
body {
    background: lightgoldenrodyellow;
}
```

That's all the CSS, but so far it's not actually linked to the HTML page! The HTML needs a `link` element pointing to the CSS file.

### HTML Link
1. In the `html` tag, above the `body`, create a new `head` element
    - The `head` should have an opening and closing tag, both above the `<body>`
1. Between the opening and closing `head` tags, create a new `link` element
1. Set the attributes of the `link` element as follows:
    - `href`: Bananas.css
    - `type`: text/css
    - `rel`: stylesheet
    
Next, open the HTML file in a browser to see the change. The background of the page should appear yellow-ish!

## Adding More `body` Styles
Any **declaration** within the `body` **ruleset** will apply by default to any element on the webpage.

1. Make the text color for the page a deep blue
	- Create a new declaration on its own line in the `body` ruleset
	- Property: `color`
	- Value: `darkblue`
1. Make the font for the page a nice sans-serif font
	- Create a new declaration on its own line in the `body` ruleset
	- Property: `font-family`
	- Value: `Tahoma`

##### Code
```css
body {
    background: lightgoldenrodyellow;
    color: darkblue;
    font-family: Tahoma;
}
```

## Styling the Images
The images on the page are good, but they are a little too big. Use CSS to update their size.

1. In the CSS file, create a new ruleset for images
	- Start on a new line under the `body` ruleset
	- Create an image ruleset with `img` and opening/closing curly brackets (`{}`)
1. Within the `img` ruleset, add a declaration for height
	- Property: `height`
	- Value: `150px`

##### Code
```css
img {
    height: 150px;
}
```

## Styling the Main Header
The top `h1` should have some special styling as the header for the whole page.

1. In the CSS file, create a new ruleset for `h1`
1. In the `h1` ruleset, create a declaration setting the color to goldenrod
	- Property: `color`
	- Value: `goldenrod`
1. In the `h1` ruleset, create a declaration setting the font to comic sans
	- Property: `font-family`
	- Value: `cursive`
1. In the `h1` ruleset, create a declaration setting the text size to 50 pixels
	- Property: `font-size`
	- Value: `50px`

##### Code
```css
h1 {
    color: goldenrod;
    font-family: cursive;
    font-size: 50px;
}
```

## Styling the Price
The price for the banana is within a `span` element, which is a generic inline container for phrasing content. It is generally used to group elements for styling purposes. Since the price is in a `span`, it is possible to style it separately from the surrounding elements.

1. In the CSS file, create a new ruleset for `span`
1. In the `span` ruleset, create declarations for the following properties and values:
	- `color` / `forestgreen`
	- `font-weight` / `bold`
	- `font-size` / `30px`
	- `font-family` / `consolas`

##### Code
```css
span {
    color: forestgreen;
    font-weight: bold;
    font-size: 30px;
    font-family: consolas;
}
```

## Final CSS
```css
body {
    background: lightgoldenrodyellow;
    color: darkblue;
    font-family: Tahoma;
}

img {
    height: 150px;
}

h1 {
    color: goldenrod;
    font-family: cursive;
    font-size: 50px;
}

span {
    color: forestgreen;
    font-weight: bold;
    font-size: 30px;
    font-family: consolas;
}
```
