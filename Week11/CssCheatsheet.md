# CSS Cheatsheet
## Ruleset
A **ruleset** is how CSS applies styles to specific elements. To define a ruleset, use:
- A _selector_
- Opening curly bracket (`{`)
- A set of _declarations_
- Closing curly bracket (`}`)

#### Example
```css
p {
    color: red;
    font-size: 20px;
}
```

## Declaration
A **declaration** is a specific CSS _property_ set to a property _value_. To define a declaration, use:
- Property name
- Colon (`:`)
- Property value
- Semi-colon (`;`)

#### Example
```css
color: red;
```

## Selector
A **selector** specifies which part of the HTML to style.

### Element selector
The **element selector** selects all elements of the given type. Use the tag type that appears in the HTML.

#### Examples
```css
p {
    /* styles all paragraphs */
}

a {
    /* styles all hyperlinks */
}
```

### ID selector
The **ID selector** selects one specific HTML element based on its `id` attribute value. Use the hashtag (`#`) followed by the value of the `id` attribute for the element.

#### HTML
```html
<h1 id="header1">Header1</h1>
```

#### CSS
```css
#header1 {
    /* styles the specific h1 */
}
```

### Class selector
The **class selector** selects HTML elements based on the value of their `class` attribute. Use the dot (`.`) followed by the value of the `class` attribute.

#### HTML
```html
<h2 class="dark-mode">Title</h2>
<p class="dark-mode">Subtitle</p>
```

#### CSS
```css
.dark-mode {
    /* styles the h2 and p and any other element with "dark-mode" as a class */
}
```

### Pseudo-class
A **pseudo-class** selects an HTML element in a particular state. Use a normal selector, followed by a colon (`:`) and the name of the pseudo-class.

#### Example
```css
p:hover {
    /* selects all paragraphs when the user hovers over them */
}
```

## Property/Value
A **property** is an identifier that defines which feature to style. A **value** describes the specific style for the property. Refer to https://htmldog.com/references/css/properties/ to see a complete list of available properties.

### Examples
```css
* {
    background-color: black; /* changes the background color */
    border: 1px solid red; /* adds a solid red border with 1px width */
    box-shadow: -2px 2px 5px black; /* adds a black shadow with 5px blur, 2px to the left and 2px down */
    cursor: pointer; /* makes the cursor into a hand */
    font-family: cursive; /* sets the font to comic sans */
    font-size: 20px; /* sets the size of the text to 20px */
    height: 500px; /* sets the height to 500px */
    width: 500px; /* sets the width to 500px */
    transition: color 1s; /* specifies that when this element changes its color property, it will take one second */
    transform: rotate(90deg); /* specifies that this element should rotate 90 degrees */
}
```

## Bootstrap
**Bootstrap** is a CSS framework designed to make a webpage _responsive_ out-of-the-box. This means it should look good on any device, so the elements automatically morph and shift based upon the viewer window.

### Bootstrap link
Include the following `link` within the `<head></head>` element to import Bootstrap's CSS:
```html
<link href="https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.3.1/css/bootstrap.min.css" rel="stylesheet">
```

### Bootstrap classes
Bootstrap CSS comes with many built-in class rulesets. Add these to elements on an HTML page after importing the Bootstrap stylesheet and the styles will apply automatically.

- `jumbotron`: creates a big banner header from a `div`
- `text-center`: centers text
- `container`: adds space on the sides of a `div`
- `row`: creates a grid row (usually used on a `div` within a "container")
- `col-md-*`: creates a grid column (used on `div`s within "row"s)

### Bootstrap columns
When creating columns within a Bootstrap row, there are 12 total units for width. These 12 units are distributed equally throughout the width of the row. A column can take up any number of these 12 units, but all columns in the row should add up to 12 total units. To set the width on a Bootstrap column within a row, add a `class` of `col-md-*`, replacing "*" with the number (1-12) of single columns for the width.
